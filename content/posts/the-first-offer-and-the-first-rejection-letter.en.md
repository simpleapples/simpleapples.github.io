I received the first offer of my life three hours ago from a large software company in China.

Two days ago, I attended the company's presentation at my school, more out of curiosity than anything else. With the mindset of gaining experience, I participated in the on-site written test and interview.

And just three hours ago, a fresh offer was placed in front of me.

Oh, so this is what an offer looks like.

Oh, so this is how amiable HR can be when extending an offer.

Suddenly, my life experience has grown a bit richer.

I examined it carefully, like a delicate greeting card, much more appealing than my college acceptance letter.

Now, three hours later, I am about to send out the first rejection letter of my life.

Yes, I'm rejecting the offer I just received.

For one reason.

While I'm young, I want to give myself a chance to strive.
