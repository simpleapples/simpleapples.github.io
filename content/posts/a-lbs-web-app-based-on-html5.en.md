A web app created using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 that can display the current location and movement path.

It utilizes the Baidu Maps API to draw the day's path with a green line on the map.

A marker shows the current location.

The circle on the homepage is drawn using canvas, but I haven't managed to include text in it yetâ€”still working on that.

The acquired data is stored in localStorage. Currently, it locates every 3 seconds. I'm unsure about the data volume; if it's large, localStorage might not be suitable.

I haven't thoroughly tested it yet, so there are likely several bugs.

This is how it runs on my mobile browser, though the location accuracy isn't very precise = =!
